## Hi there, I'm Joana Cardoso 👋

I'm currently in my third and last year of my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico- Lisbon, Portugal.

I have hands-on programming experience across multiple paradigms, including Python, C, C++, Java, Assembly, and R, among other languages and technologies.

In here, you can find some projects i have developed!
